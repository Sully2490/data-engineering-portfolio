# Data Engineering Portfolio

End-to-end data engineering projects focused on defense and autonomous systems. ETL pipelines, streaming architectures, cloud infrastructure, and data quality frameworks.

## About This Portfolio

I'm an Army veteran transitioning into data engineering. These projects demonstrate real-world skills in building scalable data infrastructure, from batch processing to real-time streaming.

**Focus Areas:** Defense tech, autonomous systems, sensor data, mission-critical pipelines

## Projects

### 01 - Batch ETL Pipeline
Automated daily pipeline extracting defense industry news from public APIs, transforming with Python, and loading to PostgreSQL via Airflow.

`Python` `Airflow` `PostgreSQL` `REST APIs`

[View Project](./01-batch-etl-pipeline)

---

### 02 - Real-Time Streaming Pipeline
Kafka-based pipeline processing simulated sensor telemetry in real-time with sub-second latency for anomaly detection.

`Kafka` `Python` `AWS Kinesis`

[View Project](./02-streaming-pipeline)

---

### 03 - Data Lake Architecture
S3-based data lake with bronze/silver/gold zones. Proper partitioning, AWS Glue cataloging, and Athena query optimization.

`AWS S3` `Glue` `Athena` `Parquet`

[View Project](./03-data-lake)

---

### 04 - CDC Pipeline
Change Data Capture using Debezium to track database changes and propagate updates downstream in near real-time.

`Debezium` `Kafka` `PostgreSQL`

[View Project](./04-cdc-pipeline)

---

### 05 - Data Quality Framework
Reusable validation framework with automated quality checks, failure alerting, and data lineage tracking.

`Great Expectations` `Python` `Slack Alerts`

[View Project](./05-data-quality)

---

### 06 - CI/CD for Data Pipelines
Containerized pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and deployment. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform.

`Docker` `GitHub Actions` `Terraform`

[View Project](./06-cicd-pipeline)

---

### 07 - Serverless Pipeline
Event-driven ETL using AWS Lambda and Step Functions. Zero infrastructure management with automatic scaling.

`AWS Lambda` `Step Functions` `S3 Triggers`

[View Project](./07-serverless-pipeline)

---

### 08 - Autonomous Systems Platform *(Capstone)*
End-to-end data platform ingesting simulated UAV telemetry, processing sensor fusion data, and serving analytics dashboards. Combines batch and streaming.

`Airflow` `Kafka` `AWS` `Docker` `Terraform`

[View Project](./08-autonomous-systems-platform)

---

### 09 - US-Aligned Raw Materials Sourcing Pipeline
Data pipeline for identifying and tracking raw material suppliers from the US and allied nations. Alliance classification, critical mineral tracking, and supply chain risk scoring for sourcing decisions.

`Python` `Airflow` `PostgreSQL` `AWS S3` `dbt` `Streamlit`

[View Project](./09-us-sourcing-pipeline)
